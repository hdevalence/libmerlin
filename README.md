## A single-file C implementation of Merlin transcripts.

When finished, this repository will contain a portable single-file C
implementation of the Merlin transcript and RNG API for use by C libraries.

More information about Merlin can be found in the documentation for the [Rust
implementation][merlin_rs].

This implementation is derived from David Leon Gil's `keccak-tiny`.
